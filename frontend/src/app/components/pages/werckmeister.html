<p>Consider the beauty of lead sheet music: you write a melody and some chords. Thats it.
<br>Later you can tell your band in which style the piece has to be played. You can say, after 4 beats play it as a bossa nova or a blues or whatever.</p>
<p>This is the idea behind Werckmeister. Of course it can not replace a band or a musician but it offers you a tool to write melodies and chords then you can define how to interpret the chords along your melody or even define your own interpretation templates.</p>
<h2 id="why-text-only-and-no-gui">Why text only and no GUI</h2>
<p>The motivation behind this decision cames with an experience which I had in the past with a professional scorewriter software I was using back in the early 2000.</p>
<p>This software was a bit clunky but I&#39;ve got used to it. At some point the developer discontinued the support for my version and I&#39;ve got more and more problems to get the software running on a modern system. The other problem was, that my project files were written in a proprietary format. </p>
<p>So I realized: 
<br><strong>not I am the owner of my written music, the company behind the scorewriter software owns it
 and if I want to continue using my projects I have to pay money.</strong></p>
<p>So I&#39;ve came to the conclusion, that readable text files is my way to go.</p>
<p><em>What is so hard writing notes in a text edior such as <code>c d e f g</code> in comparison to an overloaded clunky editor software.
<br>(actually notes in a score have a lot advantages in comparison to a text file regarding readability etc., but that aside)</em></p>
<p>I&#39;ve discovered that <a href="http://lilypond.org/">LilyPond</a> is a good way to write music using textfiles.
But for me there was a problem: LilyPond&#39;s main purpose is make score visible. So the LilyPond language is designed to describe how notes have to look on paper in the first place. Basically, I wanted the same but with the focus on how the notes sounds played by MIDI instruments.</p>

<ul>
<li>a fast and easy way to create lead sheet music</li>
<li>that tool in your toolchain, between the initial idea of an piece and developing the details in your favourite Sequencer/DAW</li>
<li>a way to create music without a Graphical User Interface</li>
<li>a tool which relies only on human readable files</li>
</ul>

<li>a replacement to your favourite Sequencer/DAW</li>
